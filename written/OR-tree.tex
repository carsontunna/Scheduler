\title{OR-Tree Based Search For TA Assignment Problem}
\date{October 2013}
\author{Carson Tunna, Tyler Smith, Adam Thompson}


\begin{document}

In the input we're given the following a set of time
slots\footnotemark. These time slots consits of a set of days MWF,
MW, TR and a time in 24 hour format. Additioally were given a set of
TA's that have their own schedule that must be adhered to. We're
looking for the existence of as assignment(and if it exists, the
optimal solution) such that all time slots are filled with available
TA's. Enter OR-Tree based search.\\

The natural language explanation of the algorithm is as follows:\\





\footnotetext{Time slots will be denoted $TS = (D, T)$ where $D \in \{MWF, MW, TR\}$
and $T = \{ x:y | 00 \leq x \leq 23 \land 00 \leq y \leq 59  \}$. I.e.
MWF0900 and TR2100.}
